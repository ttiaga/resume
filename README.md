            Create an API endpoint that presents your resume as a JSON object. You are free to take this in any direction beyond the raw JSON object.
            Once you have created the API endpoint send me a link to the GitHub repo where your code is. The repo should include enabling code, the URL, and resulting resume in JSON format.
